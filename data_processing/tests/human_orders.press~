Take Constantinople with your fleet. I'm moving SMY to ANK with arm
support. I think sam will try to move to smy from ANK.

Will do!
"

You should move BOH - SIL. It will make defending that part of the map
easier.
"
RUSSIA,AUSTRIA,RUSSIA,AUSTRIA,F1907M,,"
I think that you should move SIL - PRU. I will support with WAR. Then
you should BOH - SIL and VIE - BOH. If we are successful with this, it
will destroy the PRU army which would help us both out right about now.

P.S. Never mind, seems you already submitted orders!

Unless you have a better idea?
"

I agree with your approach, except I think you should:

GAR S WAR - SIL
SMY - CON

I will

WAR - SIL
CON - AEG (we will destroy F GRE next turn)
UKR S WAR
MOS - LVN (for support cutting purposes)
SEV S MOS

Sound good?

How's things?

Is this what you are talking about?
"

Hmm...this looks grim. How about:

CON - BUL
SER S AEG - GRE
EAS - ION (to cut support)
GAL - SIL
BOH S GAL - SIL

WAR S GAL - SIL
AEG - GRE
SEV S MOS
UKR S WAR

Not entirely confident that TYR will make it into VEN, but he won't
attack for sure with TRI. He needs to hold there for a turn. My guess
is, move from VEN or MUN and support with the other...

Also, France is going to be convoying over from Spain probably into
ALB. That would be my guess.

I think Vienna is toast, but I can get Budapest back. Think France will
go to Con, since it's uncontestable by either of us!

Hi Guys,

Here are my orders:

France: Army Piedmont -> Venice.
France: Fleet Gulf of Lyon -> Tuscany.
France: Fleet Naples SUPPORT English Fleet Tyrrhenian Sea -> Rome.
France: Fleet Ionian Sea -> Greece.
France: Army Marseilles SUPPORT Army Piedmont.
France: Army Burgundy HOLD.

My idea behind this is that it will be easier to get the PM into ROM
this year than VEN, but just in  case we get lucky I suggest we try
the following if you guys are willing:

England:
A TYR S A PIE-VEN

Russia:
A TRI S A PIE-VEN

If this does not work for you guys that's not a problem.  We should
get the PM into Rome this turn no matter what, and it looks like the
Tsar is going to gain some ground as well.  I think we are close to
cracking the game wide open (finally)

All the best,

France
